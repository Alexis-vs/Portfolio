I'm Data Scientist at AP-HP (Assistance Publique - HÃ´pitaux de Paris) in the Medical Informatics and Public Health department of the European Georges Pompidou Hospital. My work focuses on the development of survivalGPU, a R / python package to perform survival analyzes with GPU support, and the realization of the machine learning projects of the doctors of the hospital.
